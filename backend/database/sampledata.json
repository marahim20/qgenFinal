    "prompt": "Four hundred years ago, in the age of Witches, during a time of constant warfare; it was not uncommon for large numbers of people to clash with each other, exchange blows, and fight for their lives.\n\nBeatrice was not intimately familiar with the battlefield.\n\nShe was born and raised in the mansion of her mother, Echidna, a place free from human conflict. Even though the battles were far below her notice, they were still aggravating.\n\nAs time passed, she spent four hundred years with the book entrusted to her, during which the world outside was far from the madness of those days, although it could still be turbulent.\n\nYet, this once far distant madness was now close at hand.\n\n――That being, a struggle for countless lives all around the Imperial Capital.\n\n???: [Umm, I am worried. I am anxious.]\n\n???: [I know how you feel, Shuu. I guess Uu and the others should be leaving too?]\n\n???: [Au! Uau! Aa, u!]\n\n???: [Tha, that’s no good! Our job is to wait! We are waiting!]\n\nBeatrice, endeavoring to close her eyes and conserve energy, overheard the exchange.\n\nWhat could be heard were the voices of children she had become quite familiar with over the past few days―― Schult, Utakata, and Louis Arneb.\n\nBeatrice and the other children were settled behind the main camp―― where they waited in a tent that overlooked the battlefield from a hill, and although it sounded good to say that they protected the rear of the camp, at least Beatrice knew that this was just a pretense not to be expected of them.",
